                When Compaq launched its Portable III, the lauch was timed to occurs simultaneously in twelve countries around the world, in keeping with Compaq's showmanship style. The Portable III previously rumoured to be the smallest, lightest and fastest 386 machine but Compaq only had a 286-12 mainboard ready to be mass produced. The 386 version would follow about one year later.

                The design of the Portable II had been deeply improved over the earlier Compaq portable machines. It was half the size and its footprint occupied half the space of the first Compaq Portable. The most remarquable feature was its neat gas plasma display wich lifted up and swiveled so that it could be placed in a good position for reading.

                The machine shipped with either a 20 MB or 40 MB hard-disk. Two internal cards could be added, a RAM card (up to 2 MB) and a 1200-baud modem card. An external expansion box allowed to add two standard IBM-AT cards and carry them along with the computer. It also has a proprietary graphics mode that allows it to run at true 640 x 400 mode.
