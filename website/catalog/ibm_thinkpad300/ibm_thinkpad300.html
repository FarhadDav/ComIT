                Announced in April 1992, the ThinkPad tablet was only mildly successful, and the name was recycled into IBM's new notebook line of computers, the ThinkPad model 300, 700 and 700C. The original ThinkPad tablet became model 700T. Although they were not IBM's first line of notebook computers, the new ThinkPad series of notebook computers were an immediate hit, and collected more than 300 awards for quality and design. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The ThinkPads originally came with Microsoft DOS 5.0 operating system pre-installed, with IBM OS/2 2.0 (also by Microsoft) as the only other option, but later on Microsoft Windows 3.1 was available as a pre-installed operating system as well.

            <p>
                While the 300 and 700 have modest 9.5-inch passive LCD screens, the model 700C has a beautiful 10.5-inch active-matrix color LCD - the largest screen available on any notebook computer at the time. These early ThinkPad notebooks came with HelpWare, IBMs service package which included a one-year warranty, and 24-hour, seven-day assistance by FAX, electronic bulletin board, or toll-free telephone.
