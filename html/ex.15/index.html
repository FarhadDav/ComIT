        <p>After raising nearly $2 million since the launch of its crowdfunding campaign, Planet Computers based in London have now started shipping their Gemini PDA ultra-thin clamshell Pocket PC system which is reminiscent of the old Psion 5 organisers first launched back in the 1990s. But thankfully that's where the likeness finishes, the Gemini PDA is equipped with 4G mobile connectivity as well as supporting wireless and Bluetooth enabling both data communications and mobile phone calls. Watch the demonstration video below to learn more about the Gemini PDA which is still available to purchase via Indiegogo with prices starting from $599.</p>
        <p>
            Features of the Gemini PDA include fully integrated QWERTY keyboard, designed for Android, dual boot Linux option (this feature is still under development and is facing a few teething issues at launch Android is currently being shipped out), a large ultra-wide 5.99-inch 2160 x 1080 touchscreen and 4,220 mAh battery. "We decided to re-invent the palm-sized keyboard mobile device that will benefit many, who we think are missing using the keyboard on the move. From bloggers and creatives that need to constantly write, to professionals who need to read and write e-mail, create and edit documents and spreadsheets."

            Specifications of the Gemini PDA include a small farm factor of just 17.14 cm x 7.93 cm x 1.51 cm as well as up to two weeks of stand-by time and approximately12 hours of talk time. Dual USB-C connectors enabling users to connect keyboards, external screens, mice, charging cables and more.
